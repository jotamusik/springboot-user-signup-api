# User SignUp API Kata

In this kata the main idea is to practice the way we create an endpoint in a JSON-RPC
api as we would do on our daily work.

In this case, the endpoint will be a POST method that will receive the needed information
(you can pass as much information as you wish) in order to create a User in our system.
The minimum information required will be a username and a password.

## Trainings involved in this kata

This kata can be used to practice several things which some of them are:

- Outside-in TDD
- Error handling strategies
- Domain and Value Objects definitions
- Hexagonal Architecture definition
- E2E testing
